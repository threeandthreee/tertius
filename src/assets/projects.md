**[Races Wild](https://raceswild.3and3.dev):** Organizing and streaming bi-weekly races.

**[AP LADX](https://github.com/threeandthreee/archipelago):**  I'm currently the maintainer of Link's Awakening: DX for the [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg) multi-game multi-world randomizer.

**[Vod Sync](https://vod-sync.3and3.dev):** Sync YouTube or Twitch vods to a reference point and playback with shared controls. Designed with speedrunning in mind -- it's good for comparing full runs, comparing segments, and race playback.

**[LA/DX Menu Router](https://la-menu.3and3.dev):** Menu routing in LA/DX speedruns is hard, and everyone has their own. Here's a tool for it.

**[Shapez Blueprint Library](/blueprints):** Designed for randomizer racing but probably nice for casual play as well.
